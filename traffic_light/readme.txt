in /dqn the trained network is saved
in /data
	tl.nod.xml and tl.edg.xml are written to describe the road configuration
	tl.net.xml is the network on which vehicles drive generated by SUMO from tl.nod.xml and tl.edg.xml
	tl.rou.xml schedules each vehicle including their type, route and departure time, generated by environment.py randomly
	tl.sumocfg is the configuration file for the simulation generated by SUMO according to all above files
	tl.settings contains parameter required in simulation with SUMO-GUI

user guideline:
    the system can be execute by directly run file "algorithm.py" in either IDE or command line, (installation of SUMO is required) (http://sumo.dlr.de)
    model will be automatically saved "./dqn" directory, where "." denotes the current working space,
    also, the averaged reward will be both record in record.txt file and average_reward.png graph
